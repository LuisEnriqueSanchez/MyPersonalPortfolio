THIS FILE IS INTENDED TO BE THE EXPLANATION OF HOW THE WEBSITE IS CONSTRUTED

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN FILE: _config.yml
    here is where the sidebar is created. The sidebar is the landing page because when you enter the 
    blog or the contents, it is minimized to the left.

Inside this file is the author, language, title, sub title (tagline), metadescription,
keywords, logo ( to be understood how the image need to be shown).

The most important part that creates the site structure is the menu and legal areas. Those are created 
with titles and urls that are the entries.

The example route redirect the user to a featured category. This means that is a landing page to other pages
e.g. could be the portfolio main page and inside you can create a small description and later 
the different post of the projects.

You can group the post by category or tags
    - A category is a label you assign to posts to group them by topic or section.
    - A tag is another label for posts, used to describe specific topics or keywords.
    Tags are not part of the URL but help users find related content.
